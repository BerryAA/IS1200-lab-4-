## Questions for Assignment 1

### Explain how each of the ALU functions are defined. In particular, you need to be able to explain how subtraction works, including the use of two's complement.
#### Answer:

### How did you implement the logic for the Zero output port? Did you consider any alternatives? Be prepared to explain your design choices.
#### Answer:

### What is the purpose of the ALU? Why are several functions grouped together into one component?
#### Answer:

## Questions for Assignment 2

### Explain if the read operation or the write operation, or both operations are clocked (updated at the clock edge). Why is it implement this way?
## Answer:

### Explain the semantics of reading from and writing to $0, and how you implemented this behavior.
## Answer

### How many bits of data can this register file store? If the address width was the same size as for a complete 32-bits MIPS processor, how many bits would in such a case such register file store?
## Answer:

## Questions for Assignment 3

### Explain how you have implemented the control signals for the beq instruction. Why is this a correct solution?
## Answer:

### Be prepared to explain why the RegDst control signal or the AluSrc signal is hooked up to certain signals. You should be prepared to explain this using the following figure.
## Answer:

## Questions for Assignment 4

### Explain how the bit selection works for the alternatives that are controlled by the RegDst control signal. Which instructions are using what logic and why?
## Answer:

### Explain how the beq instruction is implement, how the address is calculated, and how the signals are controlled by the control unit.
## Answer:

## Questions for Assignment 5

### Show and explain how the factorial function works for arbitrary input value n (the teaching assistant will give you the value that you should test). Be prepared so that you know how to change the input value easily.
## Answer:

### Explain how you implemented unconditional jumps in your program.
